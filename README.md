# DFP (DIGITAL FORUM PROTOCOL)

• A multi-threaded implementation of an application-level protocol that controls the flow of basic application-level commands
for a digital forum using the general socket programming in Python.

• Wrote both the server and client-side implementation of the protocol, and utilized object-oriented programming for creating
a sustainable codebase. Used TCP-like authentication process by creating tokens in DFP_CONSTS.py. Also supported
uploading and deleting files for multiple users and created a heartbeat packet thread implementation for Exit and shutdown
of the server.
